This project only depends on the monotorrent library.

The official source and project can be found at https://github.com/mono/monotorrent
and is distributed under the MIT/X11 license.

However due to a bug in the work in progress version of monotorrent torrents may
not be able to properly stop. Thus a slightly changed version of monotorrent is used.
This version can be found at https://github.com/dufernst/monotorrent

The compiled dlls MonoTorrent.dll and MonoTorrent.Dht.dll should be placed in this directory.
